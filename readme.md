The results table in the new UI looks much cleaner than the old one. In the old one, the texts are messy and the background color is 
the same for all rows and columns which are not distinguishable. In the new UI, there's contrasting colors for information rows and 
header rows, and the header is sticky which helps users to know what the information they are looking at when they scrow down the page.s
